<p><span class="bold">Three Apparitions</span> is a group of three tired dads struggling through bleary eyes and foggy brains to bring you top-tier tabletop roleplaying content.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Chris Kitching</span> decorates his home with gargoyles and dragon skulls. Torchbearer for his familyâ€™s legacy business by day, Dungeon Delver and ravenous Philadelphia sports fan by night, he is always eager to play games and explore imagination with friends.</p>

<p><span class="bold">James Boyle</span> slogs through life with a picture in his head and a pencil in his hand. Rarely do these work together in concert. He is the artist behind the popular Philly Tarot Deck and co-creator of The Orphan King graphic novel.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Lou DiDomenico</span> is a lifelong tabletop gamer, GM, writer, musician, and programmer who does only one of the aforementioned things professionally. Try to guess which.</p>
